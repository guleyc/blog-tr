1\. Cost Structure in Open Pit Mining
-------------------------------------

### 1.1. Fixed Costs

Fixed costs are costs that remain constant regardless of production volume. The main fixed cost elements in open pit mining are:

-   **Capital investments:** Investments in fixed assets such as mining equipment, infrastructure, and facilities.
-   **Personnel costs:** Payments to permanent employees, including salaries, bonuses, and social security contributions.
-   **Rent and leasing costs:** Rent for mining areas and equipment leasing costs.
-   **Insurance and taxes:** Legal obligations such as business insurance, taxes, and fees.

#### 1.1.1. Calculating Fixed Costs

Various formulas can be used for calculating and analyzing fixed costs:

**Fixed Cost per Unit (FCU):**

    FCU = Total Fixed Costs / Production Volume

**Capital Cost (Straight-Line Depreciation):**

    Straight-Line Depreciation Rate = 1 / Useful Life (in years)
    Annual Depreciation = Equipment Cost × Straight-Line Depreciation Rate

**Capital Cost (Declining Balance Depreciation):**

    Declining Balance Rate = 2 × Straight-Line Depreciation Rate
    Annual Depreciation = Remaining Book Value × Declining Balance Rate

**Capital Cost (Units of Production Depreciation):**

    Depreciation per Unit = (Equipment Cost - Salvage Value) / Estimated Total Production
    Annual Depreciation = Depreciation per Unit × Annual Production

#### 1.1.2. Fixed Cost Analysis Example

Let's analyze fixed costs for an open pit coal mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual fixed costs: $10 million
-   Annual production capacity: 1 million tons of coal
-   Excavator purchase cost: $5 million
-   Estimated salvage value of excavator: $500,000
-   Useful life of excavator: 10 years
-   Estimated total production of excavator: 10 million tons

**Calculations:**

1\. **Fixed Cost per Unit:**

    FCU = $10,000,000 / 1,000,000 tons = $10/ton

2\. **Straight-Line Depreciation:**

    Straight-Line Depreciation Rate = 1 / 10 = 0.10 (or 10%)
    Annual Depreciation = $5,000,000 × 0.10 = $500,000/year

3\. **Declining Balance Depreciation (first year):**

    Declining Balance Rate = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 (or 20%)
    Annual Depreciation (1st year) = $5,000,000 × 0.20 = $1,000,000
    Remaining Book Value (end of 1st year) = $5,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $4,000,000
    Annual Depreciation (2nd year) = $4,000,000 × 0.20 = $800,000

4\. **Units of Production Depreciation:**

    Depreciation per Unit = ($5,000,000 - $500,000) / 10,000,000 tons = $0.45/ton
    Annual Depreciation (for 1 million tons) = $0.45/ton × 1,000,000 tons = $450,000

These calculations show how different depreciation methods affect capital costs. Straight-line depreciation provides equal depreciation throughout the equipment's useful life, while declining balance depreciation provides higher depreciation in the early years. Units of production depreciation calculates depreciation based on equipment usage.

### 1.2. Variable Costs

Variable costs are costs that change with production volume. The main variable cost elements in open pit mining are:

-   **Energy costs:** Cost of electricity, diesel, and other energy sources.
-   **Explosives and consumables:** Cost of explosives, chemicals, drilling, and other consumables.
-   **Transportation and haulage costs:** Cost of transporting and processing products and raw materials.
-   **Maintenance and repair costs:** Expenditures for equipment maintenance and repair.

#### 1.2.1. Calculating Variable Costs

Various formulas can be used for calculating and analyzing variable costs:

**Variable Cost per Unit (VCU):**

    VCU = Total Variable Costs / Production Volume

**Total Variable Cost (TVC):**

    TVC = VCU × Production Volume

**Energy Cost:**

    Energy Cost = Unit Energy Consumption × Unit Energy Price × Production Volume

**Explosive Cost:**

    Explosive Cost = Explosive Consumption Rate (kg/ton) × Explosive Unit Price ($/kg) × Production Volume (tons)

**Transportation Cost:**

    Transportation Cost = Transportation Distance (km) × Unit Transportation Cost ($/ton-km) × Production Volume (tons)

**Maintenance Cost:**

    Maintenance Cost = Equipment Value × Maintenance Rate (%)

#### 1.2.2. Variable Cost Analysis Example

Let's analyze variable costs for an open pit copper mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual production: 5 million tons of ore
-   Unit energy consumption: 15 kWh/ton
-   Energy price: $0.10/kWh
-   Explosive consumption rate: 0.5 kg/ton
-   Explosive unit price: $2/kg
-   Average transportation distance: 3 km
-   Unit transportation cost: $0.20/ton-km
-   Total equipment value: $50 million
-   Annual maintenance rate: 5%

**Calculations:**

1\. **Energy Cost:**

    Energy Cost = 15 kWh/ton × $0.10/kWh × 5,000,000 tons = $7,500,000
    Unit Energy Cost = $7,500,000 / 5,000,000 tons = $1.50/ton

2\. **Explosive Cost:**

    Explosive Cost = 0.5 kg/ton × $2/kg × 5,000,000 tons = $5,000,000
    Unit Explosive Cost = $5,000,000 / 5,000,000 tons = $1.00/ton

3\. **Transportation Cost:**

    Transportation Cost = 3 km × $0.20/ton-km × 5,000,000 tons = $3,000,000
    Unit Transportation Cost = $3,000,000 / 5,000,000 tons = $0.60/ton

4\. **Maintenance Cost:**

    Maintenance Cost = $50,000,000 × 0.05 = $2,500,000
    Unit Maintenance Cost = $2,500,000 / 5,000,000 tons = $0.50/ton

5\. **Total Variable Cost:**

    TVC = $1.50/ton + $1.00/ton + $0.60/ton + $0.50/ton = $3.60/ton
    Total Variable Cost = $3.60/ton × 5,000,000 tons = $18,000,000

This analysis shows the distribution of variable costs and the total variable cost. Energy cost stands out as the largest variable cost item.

### 1.3. Impact on Profitability

Fixed and variable costs have a significant impact on the profitability of open pit mining operations.

#### 1.3.1. Profitability Analysis Formulas

The basic formulas used in profitability analysis are:

**Total Cost (TC):**

    TC = Total Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs

**Unit Cost (UC):**

    UC = TC / Production Volume = FCU + VCU

**Contribution Margin (CM):**

    CM = Selling Price - VCU

**Contribution Margin Ratio (CMR):**

    CMR = CM / Selling Price

**Break-Even Point (BEP) (in Units):**

    BEP (units) = Total Fixed Costs / CM

**Break-Even Point (BEP) (in Value):**

    BEP (value) = Total Fixed Costs / CMR

**Profit:**

    Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
    Profit = (Selling Price × Production Volume) - (FCU × Production Volume + VCU × Production Volume)
    Profit = Production Volume × (Selling Price - FCU - VCU)

**Profit Margin:**

    Profit Margin = Profit / Total Revenue

#### 1.3.2. Profitability Analysis Example

Let's analyze profitability for an open pit coal mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual fixed costs: $10 million
-   Unit variable cost: $200/ton
-   Annual production capacity: 1 million tons of coal
-   Coal selling price: $500/ton

**Calculations:**

1\. **Fixed Cost per Unit:**

    FCU = $10,000,000 / 1,000,000 tons = $10/ton

2\. **Total Cost:**

    TC = $10,000,000 + ($200/ton × 1,000,000 tons) = $10,000,000 + $200,000,000 = $210,000,000

3\. **Unit Cost:**

    UC = $10/ton + $200/ton = $210/ton

4\. **Contribution Margin:**

    CM = $500/ton - $200/ton = $300/ton

5\. **Contribution Margin Ratio:**

    CMR = $300/ton / $500/ton = 0.60 (or 60%)

6\. **Break-Even Point (in Units):**

    BEP (units) = $10,000,000 / $300/ton = 33,333 tons

7\. **Break-Even Point (in Value):**

    BEP (value) = $10,000,000 / 0.60 = $16,666,667

8\. **Profit:**

    Profit = 1,000,000 tons × ($500/ton - $10/ton - $200/ton)
    Profit = 1,000,000 tons × $290/ton = $290,000,000

9\. **Profit Margin:**

    Total Revenue = $500/ton × 1,000,000 tons = $500,000,000
    Profit Margin = $290,000,000 / $500,000,000 = 0.58 (or 58%)

This analysis shows the mine's profitability and break-even point. The break-even point is the production volume at which the mine starts to make a profit. In this example, the mine reaches the break-even point at 33,333 tons of coal.

#### 1.3.3. Impact of Fixed and Variable Costs on Profitability

Fixed costs have a significant impact on profitability. Reducing fixed costs is an important step to increase profitability. This can be done through more efficient equipment use, optimizing the number of employees, and cost-saving supply chain management.

Variable costs are directly related to production volume. Increasing production volume can lead to lower unit variable costs and increased profitability.

**Example:**

To see the impact of production volume on profitability, let's analyze profitability at different production levels:

| Production (tons) | Total Fixed Cost ($) | Total Variable Cost ($) | Total Cost ($) | Total Revenue ($) | Profit ($) | Profit Margin (%) |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|--------------|
| 500,000      | 10,000,000                 | 100,000,000                   | 110,000,000          | 250,000,000         | 140,000,000 | 56.0        |
| 750,000      | 10,000,000                 | 150,000,000                   | 160,000,000          | 375,000,000         | 215,000,000 | 57.3        |
| 1,000,000    | 10,000,000                 | 200,000,000                   | 210,000,000          | 500,000,000         | 290,000,000 | 58.0        |
| 1,250,000    | 10,000,000                 | 250,000,000                   | 260,000,000          | 625,000,000         | 365,000,000 | 58.4        |
| 1,500,000    | 10,000,000                 | 300,000,000                   | 310,000,000          | 750,000,000         | 440,000,000 | 58.7        |

As shown in this table, profit margin increases as production volume increases. This is because fixed costs are distributed over more production units.

2\. Cost Analysis Methods
-------------------------

### 2.1. Total Cost Method (TCM)

The Total Cost Method (TCM) is one of the simplest cost analysis methods. It is based on calculating total cost as the sum of fixed and variable costs. This method is useful for understanding general cost trends and the relationship between cost and production volume.

#### 2.1.1. TCM Formulas

**Total Cost Function:**

    TC = TFC + TVC
    TC = TFC + (VCU × Q)

Where:

-   TC = Total Cost
-   TFC = Total Fixed Costs
-   TVC = Total Variable Costs
-   VCU = Variable Cost per Unit
-   Q = Production Volume

**Average Cost Function:**

    AC = TC / Q = TFC / Q + VCU

Where:

-   AC = Average Cost (Unit Cost)

**Marginal Cost Function:**

    MC = d(TC)/dQ = VCU

Where:

-   MC = Marginal Cost

#### 2.1.2. TCM Analysis Example

Let's analyze TCM for an open pit coal mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual fixed costs: $10 million
-   Unit variable cost: $200/ton
-   Annual production capacity: 1 million tons of coal

**Calculations:**

1\. **Total Cost:**

    TC = $10,000,000 + ($200/ton × 1,000,000 tons) = $210,000,000

2\. **Average Cost (Unit Cost):**

    AC = $210,000,000 / 1,000,000 tons = $210/ton

Alternative calculation:

    AC = $10,000,000 / 1,000,000 tons + $200/ton = $10/ton + $200/ton = $210/ton

3\. **Marginal Cost:**

    MC = $200/ton

4\. **Cost Analysis at Different Production Levels:**

   | Production (tons) | Total Fixed Cost ($) | Total Variable Cost ($) | Total Cost ($) | Unit Cost ($/ton) |
   |--------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
   | 500,000      | 10,000,000                 | 100,000,000                   | 110,000,000          | 220                     |
   | 750,000      | 10,000,000                 | 150,000,000                   | 160,000,000          | 213.33                  |
   | 1,000,000    | 10,000,000                 | 200,000,000                   | 210,000,000          | 210                     |
   | 1,250,000    | 10,000,000                 | 250,000,000                   | 260,000,000          | 208                     |
   | 1,500,000    | 10,000,000                 | 300,000,000                   | 310,000,000          | 206.67                  |

As shown in this table, unit cost decreases as production volume increases. This is because fixed costs are distributed over more production units.

### 2.2. Activity-Based Costing (ABC)

Activity-Based Costing (ABC) provides a more detailed cost analysis by allocating costs to activities. This reveals cost drivers more clearly and supports resource optimization. In open pit mining, the following activities are important for cost analysis:

-   **Investment costs:** Equipment purchase and maintenance.
-   **Transportation and operation costs:** Excavation, loading, and coal transportation.
-   **Management and administrative costs:** General administrative expenses of the operation.

#### 2.2.1. ABC Formulas

**Activity Pool Cost:**

    Activity Pool Cost = Σ (All Costs Related to the Activity)

**Activity Cost Driver Rate:**

    Activity Cost Driver Rate = Activity Pool Cost / Activity Cost Driver Quantity

**Activity Cost Assigned to Product:**

    Activity Cost Assigned to Product = Activity Cost Driver Rate × Activity Quantity Consumed by Product

**Total Product Cost (ABC):**

    Total Product Cost = Σ (All Activity Costs Assigned to Product)

#### 2.2.2. ABC Analysis Example

Let's analyze ABC for an open pit copper mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual production: 5 million tons of ore
-   Activity pools and costs:
    -   Drilling and blasting: $15 million
    -   Loading: $10 million
    -   Transportation: $25 million
    -   Crushing: $20 million
    -   Grinding: $30 million
-   Activity cost drivers:
    -   Drilling and blasting: 2 million hole-meters
    -   Loading: 100,000 loading hours
    -   Transportation: 2.5 million truck-kilometers
    -   Crushing: 5 million tons of processed material
    -   Grinding: 4 million grinding hours

**Calculations:**

1\. **Activity Cost Driver Rates:**

    Drilling and Blasting Rate = $15,000,000 / 2,000,000 hole-meters = $7.50/hole-meter
    Loading Rate = $10,000,000 / 100,000 loading hours = $100/loading hour
    Transportation Rate = $25,000,000 / 2,500,000 truck-kilometers = $10/truck-kilometer
    Crushing Rate = $20,000,000 / 5,000,000 tons = $4/ton
    Grinding Rate = $30,000,000 / 4,000,000 grinding hours = $7.50/grinding hour

2\. **Activity Costs per Unit (for 1 ton of ore):**

Assume that for 1 ton of ore:

-   0.4 hole-meters are used
-   0.02 loading hours are spent
-   0.5 truck-kilometers are traveled
-   1 ton of crushing is done
-   0.8 grinding hours are spent

    Drilling and Blasting Cost = $7.50/hole-meter × 0.4 hole-meters = $3.00/ton
    Loading Cost = $100/loading hour × 0.02 loading hours = $2.00/ton
    Transportation Cost = $10/truck-kilometer × 0.5 truck-kilometers = $5.00/ton
    Crushing Cost = $4/ton × 1 ton = $4.00/ton
    Grinding Cost = $7.50/grinding hour × 0.8 grinding hours = $6.00/ton

3\. **Total Unit Cost (ABC):**

    Total Unit Cost = $3.00 + $2.00 + $5.00 + $4.00 + $6.00 = $20.00/ton

4\. **Total Cost Distribution:**

    Drilling and Blasting: $3.00/ton (15%)
    Loading: $2.00/ton (10%)
    Transportation: $5.00/ton (25%)
    Crushing: $4.00/ton (20%)
    Grinding: $6.00/ton (30%)

This analysis shows which activities have the highest costs. In this example, grinding and transportation constitute the highest cost items. This information can help determine where cost reduction efforts should be focused.

### 2.3. Life Cycle Costing (LCC)

Life Cycle Costing (LCC) takes into account costs throughout the entire life cycle of a mining project. This includes everything from investment costs to abandonment costs. LCC is useful in long-term decision-making processes and in evaluating investment projects.

#### 2.3.1. LCC Formulas

**Net Present Value (NPV):**

    NPV = Σ [Ct / (1 + r)^t] - C0

Where:

-   Ct = Cash flow in year t
-   r = Discount rate
-   t = Time (year)
-   C0 = Initial investment

**Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC):**

    EAC = NPV × [r(1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)]

Where:

-   n = Project life (years)

**Total Life Cycle Cost:**

    LCC = Investment Cost + Σ [Operating Cost / (1 + r)^t] + Σ [Maintenance Cost / (1 + r)^t] + [Salvage Value / (1 + r)^n]

#### 2.3.2. LCC Analysis Example

Let's analyze LCC for a new processing facility investment for an open pit mine:

**Data:**

-   Initial investment (C0): $50 million
-   Annual operating cost: $10 million
-   Annual maintenance cost: $2 million
-   Facility life (n): 15 years
-   Salvage value: $5 million
-   Discount rate (r): 10% (0.10)

**Calculations:**

1\. **Annual Cash Flows:**

Annual total cost = Operating cost + Maintenance cost = 10 + 2 = $12 million

2\. **Net Present Value (NPV):**

    NPV = -50 + Σ [-12 / (1 + 0.10)^t] + [5 / (1 + 0.10)^15]

   | Year (t) | Cash Flow ($ million) | Discount Factor (1 + 0.10)^-t | Present Value ($ million) |
   |---------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | 0       | -50                      | 1.0000                        | -50.0000                   |
   | 1       | -12                      | 0.9091                        | -10.9092                   |
   | 2       | -12                      | 0.8264                        | -9.9168                    |
   | 3       | -12                      | 0.7513                        | -9.0156                    |
   | ...     | ...                      | ...                           | ...                        |
   | 15      | -12 + 5 = -7             | 0.2394                        | -1.6758                    |
   | Total   |                          |                               | -141.8174                  |

NPV = -$141.8174 million

3\. **Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC):**

    EAC = -141.8174 × [0.10(1 + 0.10)^15 / ((1 + 0.10)^15 - 1)]
    EAC = -141.8174 × [0.10 × 4.1772 / 3.1772]
    EAC = -141.8174 × 0.1315
    EAC = -$18.6490 million/year

This shows that the equivalent annual cost of the facility is $18.65 million.

4\. **Life Cycle Cost per Unit:**

Assume the facility processes 2 million tons of ore per year:

    Unit LCC = $18.65 million/year / 2 million tons/year = $9.33/ton

This analysis shows that the life cycle cost per ton of the facility is $9.33.

LCC analysis is important for evaluating the long-term economic effects of an investment. In this example, the facility has a negative NPV, which may indicate that the investment is not economically viable. However, other factors (e.g., strategic importance, environmental benefits) should also be considered.

3\. Cost Reduction Strategies
-----------------------------

### 3.1. Production Planning Optimization

Optimization of production planning can help reduce costs by optimizing the use of raw materials and equipment. Advanced planning software and modeling techniques can be used. The production plan should take into account market demand, weather conditions, and equipment failures.

#### 3.1.1. Production Planning Optimization Formulas

**Optimum Production Volume:**

    Optimum Production Volume = Total Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Unit Variable Cost - Target Profit Margin × Selling Price)

**Optimum Stripping Ratio:**

    Optimum Stripping Ratio = (Ore Selling Value - Ore Extraction Cost - Processing Cost - Target Profit) / Overburden Excavation Cost

**Optimum Cut-off Grade:**

    Optimum Cut-off Grade = (Processing Cost + Selling Cost) / [(Metal Price × Metal Recovery Rate) - Refinery Cost]

#### 3.1.2. Production Planning Optimization Example

Let's optimize production planning for an open pit gold mine:

**Data:**

-   Total fixed costs: $20 million/year
-   Gold selling price: $1,800/oz
-   Unit variable cost: $800/oz
-   Target profit margin: 20%
-   Ore extraction cost: $3/ton
-   Processing cost: $15/ton
-   Overburden excavation cost: $2.5/ton
-   Metal recovery rate: 90%
-   Refinery cost: $20/oz

**Calculations:**

1\. **Optimum Production Volume:**

    Optimum Production Volume = $20,000,000 / ($1,800/oz - $800/oz - 0.20 × $1,800/oz)
    Optimum Production Volume = $20,000,000 / ($1,800/oz - $800/oz - $360/oz)
    Optimum Production Volume = $20,000,000 / $640/oz = 31,250 oz/year

2\. **Optimum Stripping Ratio:**

Assume the average ore grade is 2 g/ton (0.064 oz/ton) and the gold selling value is $1,800/oz:

    Ore Selling Value = 0.064 oz/ton × $1,800/oz = $115.2/ton
    
    Optimum Stripping Ratio = ($115.2/ton - $3/ton - $15/ton - 0.20 × $115.2/ton) / $2.5/ton
    Optimum Stripping Ratio = ($115.2/ton - $3/ton - $15/ton - $23.04/ton) / $2.5/ton
    Optimum Stripping Ratio = $74.16/ton / $2.5/ton = 29.66

This shows that 29.66 tons of overburden can be excavated for each ton of economically extractable ore.

3\. **Optimum Cut-off Grade:**

    Optimum Cut-off Grade = ($15/ton + $0) / [($1,800/oz × 0.90) - $20/oz]
    Optimum Cut-off Grade = $15/ton / ($1,620/oz - $20/oz)
    Optimum Cut-off Grade = $15/ton / $1,600/oz = 0.009375 oz/ton = 0.29 g/ton

This shows that ore with a grade lower than 0.29 g/ton is not economical.

Production planning optimization is critical for increasing the economic efficiency of mining operations. The above calculations can help determine the optimum production volume, stripping ratio, and cut-off grade.

### 3.2. Technology Adaptation

New technologies can improve mining operations by increasing production efficiency and reducing costs. Technologies such as autonomous trucks, drones, and data analytics can be used. Technology adaptation may require training and infrastructure investment.

#### 3.2.1. Technology Adaptation Formulas

**Technology Investment Payback Period:**

    Payback Period = Technology Investment / Annual Cost Savings

**Technology Investment Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**

The value of r that satisfies the following equation:

    0 = -C0 + Σ [Ct / (1 + r)^t]

**Autonomous Equipment Cost Savings:**

    Cost Savings = (Conventional Labor Cost - Autonomous Labor Cost) + (Conventional Fuel Consumption - Autonomous Fuel Consumption) × Fuel Price + (Conventional Maintenance Cost - Autonomous Maintenance Cost)

#### 3.2.2. Technology Adaptation Example

Let's analyze an autonomous truck fleet investment for an open pit copper mine:

**Data:**

-   Autonomous truck fleet investment: $30 million
-   Conventional labor cost: $5 million/year
-   Autonomous labor cost: $2 million/year
-   Conventional fuel consumption: 10 million liters/year
-   Autonomous fuel consumption: 8.5 million liters/year
-   Fuel price: $1.2/liter
-   Conventional maintenance cost: $4 million/year
-   Autonomous maintenance cost: $3 million/year
-   Investment life: 10 years
-   Discount rate: 8% (0.08)

**Calculations:**

1\. **Annual Cost Savings:**

    Labor Savings = $5,000,000/year - $2,000,000/year = $3,000,000/year
    Fuel Savings = (10,000,000 liters/year - 8,500,000 liters/year) × $1.2/liter = $1,800,000/year
    Maintenance Savings = $4,000,000/year - $3,000,000/year = $1,000,000/year
    
    Total Annual Savings = $3,000,000/year + $1,800,000/year + $1,000,000/year = $5,800,000/year

2\. **Payback Period:**

    Payback Period = $30,000,000 / $5,800,000/year = 5.17 years

3\. **Net Present Value (NPV):**

    NPV = -30,000,000 + Σ [5,800,000 / (1 + 0.08)^t] for t = 1 to 10

   | Year (t) | Cash Flow ($) | Discount Factor (1 + 0.08)^-t | Present Value ($) |
   |---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
   | 0       | -30,000,000       | 1.0000                        | -30,000,000         |
   | 1       | 5,800,000         | 0.9259                        | 5,370,220           |
   | 2       | 5,800,000         | 0.8573                        | 4,972,340           |
   | 3       | 5,800,000         | 0.7938                        | 4,604,040           |
   | ...     | ...               | ...                           | ...                 |
   | 10      | 5,800,000         | 0.4632                        | 2,686,560           |
   | Total   |                   |                               | 9,385,160           |

NPV = $9,385,160

A positive NPV indicates that the investment is economically viable.

4\. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**

IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero. It can be calculated by trial and error or using financial calculators/software.

In this example, IRR is approximately 15%, which shows that the investment provides a higher return than the 8% discount rate.

Technology adaptation is an important strategy for increasing the efficiency of mining operations and reducing costs. The above analysis shows that the autonomous truck fleet investment is economically viable.

### 3.3. Supply Chain Management

Optimization of supply chain management can help reduce the cost of raw materials and consumables. Long-term contracts can be established with suppliers. Inventory optimization and supply chain visibility can be provided.

#### 3.3.1. Supply Chain Management Formulas

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**

    EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Order Cost / Unit Holding Cost)

**Total Supply Chain Cost:**

    Total Cost = Purchase Cost + Order Cost + Holding Cost + Stockout Cost

Where:

-   Purchase Cost = Unit Price × Annual Demand
-   Order Cost = Cost per Order × (Annual Demand / Order Quantity)
-   Holding Cost = Unit Holding Cost × (Average Inventory)
-   Stockout Cost = Unit Stockout Cost × Stockout Probability × Annual Demand

**Supplier Selection Score:**

    Supplier Score = w1 × Price Score + w2 × Quality Score + w3 × Delivery Score + w4 × Flexibility Score

Where w1, w2, w3, and w4 are weight factors and their sum equals 1.

#### 3.3.2. Supply Chain Management Example

Let's optimize the explosive material supply chain for an open pit mine:

**Data:**

-   Annual explosive consumption: 1,000 tons
-   Explosive unit price: $2,000/ton
-   Cost per order: $500
-   Unit holding cost: $200/ton/year (10% of unit price)
-   Stockout cost: $5,000/ton
-   Stockout probability: 2%

**Calculations:**

1\. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**

    EOQ = √(2 × 1,000 tons × $500 / $200/ton) = √5,000 = 70.71 tons

Practically, this can be rounded to 70 tons.

2\. **Total Supply Chain Cost:**

Number of orders = 1,000 tons / 70 tons = 14.29 ≈ 14 orders/year

Average inventory = 70 tons / 2 = 35 tons

    Purchase Cost = $2,000/ton × 1,000 tons = $2,000,000
    Order Cost = $500/order × 14 orders = $7,000
    Holding Cost = $200/ton/year × 35 tons = $7,000
    Stockout Cost = $5,000/ton × 0.02 × 1,000 tons = $100,000
    
    Total Cost = $2,000,000 + $7,000 + $7,000 + $100,000 = $2,114,000

3\. **Supplier Comparison:**

Assume there are three suppliers and the following weights are used:

-   Price: w1 = 0.40
-   Quality: w2 = 0.30
-   Delivery: w3 = 0.20
-   Flexibility: w4 = 0.10

| Supplier | Price Score (0-100) | Quality Score (0-100) | Delivery Score (0-100) | Flexibility Score (0-100) | Total Score |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| A         | 80                  | 90                   | 70                     | 60                     | ?           |
| B         | 90                  | 75                   | 85                     | 70                     | ?           |
| C         | 70                  | 95                   | 80                     | 90                     | ?           |

    Supplier A Score = 0.40 × 80 + 0.30 × 90 + 0.20 × 70 + 0.10 × 60 = 32 + 27 + 14 + 6 = 79
    Supplier B Score = 0.40 × 90 + 0.30 × 75 + 0.20 × 85 + 0.10 × 70 = 36 + 22.5 + 17 + 7 = 82.5
    Supplier C Score = 0.40 × 70 + 0.30 × 95 + 0.20 × 80 + 0.10 × 90 = 28 + 28.5 + 16 + 9 = 81.5

According to this evaluation, Supplier B has the highest score and should be selected.

Supply chain management is an important strategy for reducing the costs of mining operations. The above analysis shows the optimization of the explosive material supply chain.

### 3.4. Effective Maintenance Programs

Regular maintenance of equipment can increase production uptime by preventing failures and reducing repair costs. Maintenance programs should be tailored to the type of equipment and operating conditions. Technologies such as predictive analytics and condition monitoring can be used for maintenance.

#### 3.4.1. Effective Maintenance Programs Formulas

**Equipment Availability:**

    Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):**

    MTBF = Total Uptime / Number of Failures

**Mean Time To Repair (MTTR):**

    MTTR = Total Downtime / Number of Failures

**Maintenance Cost Ratio:**

    Maintenance Cost Ratio = Total Maintenance Cost / Equipment Value

**Preventive Maintenance Compliance Ratio:**

    Preventive Maintenance Compliance Ratio = Preventive Maintenance Time / (Preventive Maintenance Time + Corrective Maintenance Time)

#### 3.4.2. Effective Maintenance Programs Example

Let's analyze an excavator maintenance program for an open pit mine:

**Data:**

-   Excavator value: $5 million
-   Annual uptime: 7,000 hours
-   Annual downtime: 1,000 hours
-   Annual number of failures: 50
-   Annual preventive maintenance time: 500 hours
-   Annual corrective maintenance time: 1,000 hours
-   Annual preventive maintenance cost: $300,000
-   Annual corrective maintenance cost: $700,000
-   Excavator hourly production capacity: 1,000 tons/hour
-   Ore selling value: $50/ton
-   Processing cost: $20/ton

**Calculations:**

1\. **Equipment Availability:**

    Availability = 7,000 hours / (7,000 hours + 1,000 hours) = 0.875 (or 87.5%)

2\. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):**

    MTBF = 7,000 hours / 50 failures = 140 hours/failure

3\. **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR):**

    MTTR = 1,000 hours / 50 failures = 20 hours/failure

4\. **Maintenance Cost Ratio:**

    Total Maintenance Cost = $300,000 + $700,000 = $1,000,000
    Maintenance Cost Ratio = $1,000,000 / $5,000,000 = 0.20 (or 20%)

5\. **Preventive Maintenance Compliance Ratio:**

    Preventive Maintenance Compliance Ratio = 500 hours / (500 hours + 1,000 hours) = 0.33 (or 33%)

6\. **Impact of Implementing a Predictive Maintenance Program:**

Assume that after implementing a predictive maintenance program:

-   Downtime decreases from 1,000 hours to 500 hours
-   Preventive maintenance time increases from 500 hours to 700 hours
-   Corrective maintenance time decreases from 1,000 hours to 300 hours
-   Total maintenance cost decreases from $1,000,000 to $800,000

    New Availability = 7,000 hours / (7,000 hours + 500 hours) = 0.933 (or 93.3%)
    Availability Increase = 0.933 - 0.875 = 0.058 (or 5.8%)
    
    Additional Production Hours = 0.058 × 8,000 hours = 464 hours
    Additional Production Volume = 464 hours × 1,000 tons/hour = 464,000 tons
    Additional Contribution Margin = 464,000 tons × ($50/ton - $20/ton) = $13,920,000
    
    Maintenance Cost Savings = $1,000,000 - $800,000 = $200,000
    
    Total Benefit = $13,920,000 + $200,000 = $14,120,000

This analysis shows that implementing a predictive maintenance program can provide significant economic benefits.

Effective maintenance programs are an important strategy for reducing the costs of mining operations by reducing equipment failures and extending equipment life. The above analysis shows the economic benefits that can be provided by implementing a predictive maintenance program.
