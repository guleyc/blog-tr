Calcium aluminate cements (CACs) are a type of hydraulic cement that is primarily composed of calcium aluminates. These cements are known for their rapid hardening and high-temperature resistance properties, making them suitable for various applications in the construction industry. The manufacturing process of CACs involves the use of raw materials, and one key ingredient is bauxite.

Calcium aluminate cements are mainly composed of calcium aluminates, which are compounds formed by the reaction of calcium oxide (lime) and aluminum oxide (alumina). The most common calcium aluminate compound found in these cements is monocalcium aluminate (CaAl₂O₄). Other compounds, such as dicalcium aluminate (Ca₂Al₂O₇) and tricalcium aluminate (Ca₃Al₂O₆), may also be present in smaller amounts. These different compounds contribute to the specific properties of calcium aluminate cements.

## **Production**

The production of calcium aluminate cements involves several steps, starting from the selection and preparation of raw materials. Bauxite, a sedimentary rock primarily composed of aluminum hydroxides and oxides, plays a crucial role in this process. The bauxite ore is mined and then refined to extract alumina (aluminum oxide). The alumina is then mixed with calcium carbonate or calcium oxide, which act as fluxing agents, and other additives as required. This mixture is finely ground to form a powder known as raw meal.

In the next stage, the raw meal is subjected to high-temperature sintering in a rotary kiln. The kiln operates at temperatures around 1,500 to 1,600 degrees Celsius, causing chemical reactions to occur between the raw materials. The primary reaction is the formation of calcium aluminate compounds, such as monocalcium aluminate (CaAl₂O₄), dicalcium aluminate (Ca₂Al₂O₇), and tricalcium aluminate (Ca₃Al₂O₆). These compounds contribute to the unique properties of calcium aluminate cements.

The liquefied mixture undergoes a cooling process until it reaches a vesicular, basalt-like clinker, which is then ground independently to obtain the final product. Thanks to the significant melting that usually occurs, raw materials in solid form can be utilized. A typical kiln configuration consists of a reverberatory furnace equipped with a shaft preheater, where the ascending hot exhaust gases coincide with the descending mixture of solid raw materials. The preheater efficiently recovers the majority of heat from the combustion gases, simultaneously dehydrating, dehydroxylating the bauxite, and decarbonating the limestone. Subsequently, the calcined material descends into the cool end of the molten bath.

As the furnace reaches its hot end, the molten substance overflows into molds, where it undergoes a solidification and cooling process. The system is powered by pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are subsequently subjected to crushing and grinding in a ball mill. The resulting clinker, a fused mass of solid materials, is then cooled and ground to a fine powder. In cases where high-alumina refractory cements are employed, resulting in a sintering process instead of complete melting, a rotary kiln may be employed. This powder is the calcium aluminate cement, which is ready for use in various applications.

The quality and composition of bauxite used in CAC production can impact the final properties of the cement. Factors such as alumina content, impurities, and particle size distribution of bauxite can influence the reactivity and performance of the resulting cement. Therefore, careful selection and characterization of bauxite are essential to ensure consistent and high-quality calcium aluminate cements.

Calcium aluminate cements possess several unique properties that make them advantageous for certain applications. One key property is their rapid setting and hardening. Compared to ordinary Portland cement, calcium aluminate cements can achieve high early strength development, allowing for faster construction and reduced curing times. These cements also exhibit excellent resistance to high temperatures, making them suitable for refractory applications. Furthermore, calcium aluminate cements have low shrinkage, good sulfate resistance, and high chemical stability.

Due to their specific properties, calcium aluminate cements find applications in various areas of the construction industry. They are commonly used in refractory applications, such as the production of refractory bricks and castables used in high-temperature environments like kilns, furnaces, and industrial boilers. Calcium aluminate cements are also utilized in the formulation of rapid-setting and self-leveling flooring compounds, where their fast hardening characteristics are advantageous. Additionally, these cements can be used in specialized concrete mixtures, corrosion-resistant coatings, and underground construction projects.
