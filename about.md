I hold a degree in Mining Engineering from Istanbul Technical University and have over seven years of experience in mining operations as well as office-based technical work. I have worked in all stages of the mining value chain in which I contributed to exploration, planning, production, design, and in some instances even sales.

My experience spans both open-pit and underground work. This includes participating in short and long-term mine planning, 3D mine design, as well as contributing to the design and construction of mineral processing facilities. I also improved my understanding of strategic decision making when I worked in production planning and team coordination in a publicly traded mining company.

Having worked in customer coordinating and ore selling, I have broadened my knowledge past engineering. The combination of technical and business knowledge serves me well because I can see how operations impact the business as a whole.

I love addressing hands-on technical challenges, streamlining processes, and enabling better team collaboration. I strive to make a positive impact whether it be at a worksite, on a computer, or in meetings.
